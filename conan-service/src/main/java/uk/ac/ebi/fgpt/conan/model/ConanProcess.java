/**
 * A process is a specific job that must be run as part of a {@link ConanPipeline}.  Each pipeline chains together
 * several processes, and a {@link ConanTask} executes each process in turn.
 * <p/>
 * Processes can either be created programmatically or generated automatically from metadata, where available. This
 * interface follows the Java Service Provider Interface specification allowing implementations of Process to be
 * dynamically discovered.  See the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html">Java
 * documentation</a> for more details on this.  Implementing classes should be annotated with an {
 * net.sourceforge.fluxion.spi.ServiceProvider} annotation to enable them for discovery.
 * <p/>
 * Note that because <code>Process</code>es are always programmatically instantiated (for example, using a {@link
 * java.util.ServiceLoader}), all processes should have a default constructor.
